# Eclipse Plugin for Gists

A simple eclipse plugin for github gists!

This project is built using Eclipse Tycho (https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/) and 
requires at least maven 3.0 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) 
to be built via CLI. 

Thanks to [Pixan](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsimple) for the github icons and
to the [developers of egit-github project](https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github).
